pose
    keep vector of position/velo/accel
    keep vector of transformations between

display
    init window with pose obj
    read pose from pose obj
    update display with current pose

odom main 
    init rs, odom, tsdf, pose
    
    discard frames

    loop 
        read frame
        compute transform
        compute odom
        integrate frame to tsdf

        after X frames save mesh off to file, clear out tsdf
    
        after Y frames stop
    


analysis main
    integrate meshes

    apply analysis for diff of norms

    find potholes and cracks
